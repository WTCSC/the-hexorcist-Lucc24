# Overview  
This is a little python script that does something python already does, but instead its made by a high schooler!  
Basically it takes a number and converts it to whatever base you want from 2-36
## Features

- Convert numbers from any base (2-36) to any other base (2-36)
- Interactive command-line interface
- Support for hexadecimal, binary, octal, and all bases up to base-36
## Usage

Run the script directly to use the interactive:

```
python3 hexthign.py
```

The script will prompt you to:
1. Enter the number you want to convert
2. Specify the current base of the number (2-36)
3. Specify the target base for conversion (2-36)
# Examples

### Binary to Hexadecimal
```
Input: 1010 (base 2)
Output: A (base 16)
```

### Decimal to Binary
```
Input: 42 (base 10)
Output: 101010 (base 2)
```

### Base-36 Examples
```
Input: Z (base 36) = 35 (base 10)
Input: 10 (base 36) = 36 (base 10)
```
## Requirements
